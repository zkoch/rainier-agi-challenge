## The Rainier Beer Bottlecap AGI Challenge

There's a lot of talk about AGI these days (how close is it? when will AI replace our jobs? are they smarter than college students?).

We present a more modest question: **are LLMs smarter than the average, slightly drunk person sitting in a dimly lit dive bar?**

Introducing the Rainier Bottlecap AGI Challenge, inspired by the <a href="https://arcprize.org/" target="_blank">ARC Prize</a> and a recent evening at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheShantyTavern/" target="_blank">Shanty Tavern</a>.

### What?

On the bottom of every bottlecap of <a href="https://rainierbeer.com/" target="_blank">Rainier Beer</a> is a little puzzle that maps to a short phrase. For example, the answer to the image at the top of this readme is "When it's spring time in the Rockies".

They're not hard, but they can be a bit tricky. For science, a few additional beers were ordered at the bar to ensure the puzzles remained doable (scale limits unknown -- we do not recommend finding out). No thanks necessary for this act of scientific heroism.

### The Challenge

**Submit a solution that scores 85% on our bottlecap holdback set.** The truth is that all bottlecaps are out in public, so you could cheat. But cheating is lame, so don't.

If this were fancier, we'd have a Kaggle competition. So instead, create a PR, open a discussion, or yell at me on <a href="httsp://x.com/zachk" target="_blank">X</a>.

### The Prize

The ARC prize is offering $1,000,000. That's cool, but you know what's even cooler? A 6 pack of Rainier Beer, delivered cold to the highest score.*

* It might not be cold. Oh, and you'll need to be 21. And probably in a state that accepts beer deliveries. Not a drinker or under 21? No problem! We'll send you any other drink you'd like!

### Leaderboard

| Provider      | Score         |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| OpenAI GPT-4o  | ~8%  |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet  | ~4%  |

### FAQ

**1. Is this a joke?**

No. Yes. Kind of.

**2. Is this affiliated with Rainier Beer in any way?**

No (but it'd be cool if they wanted to be affiliated).

**3. Would you recommend the Shanty Tavern in Seattle?**

Absolutely. It's run by a 92-year-old named John who still works behind the bar. It's a must-go if visiting Seattle.
